# Gadget Project

We love gadgets and we love making gadgets. The idea behind Gadget Project is a space to express our creative talents making useful mini-products that can be built or improved by fellow "tinkerers".

We try to make complete products that can be built and used by a home hobbyist, encompassing:
- Software written in high-level languages using freely available toolchains
- Electronics that require nothing more than off-the-shelf components, maybe some stripboard and a soldering iron
- Mechanical components that could be 3D-printed
- Documentation in the form of manuals and promotional material produced using free applications

# Liability

We do our best to produce usable products, but we accept no liability whatsoever if they don't perform as intended or as you expect. We suggest that you treat these projects as "toys" to play with rather than something to rely upon.

# Commercial Use

Everything here is licenced as [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) - essentially Public Domain. That means if you want to build and sell these gadgets then feel free! An acknowledgement would be nice but we leave that to your own conscience.
